## 🔍 **Overview**

The **Paytm Project** serves as a robust solution for managing digital transactions. It emphasizes secure authentication, dynamic wallet operations, and detailed transaction records. The app architecture integrates advanced tools and practices for efficiency, deployment, and maintainability, including **Docker** for containerization and **CI/CD pipelines** for consistent deployment.

----------

## 🚀 **Features**

### Authentication & Security

-   Secure session-based authentication using **NextAuth.js**.
-   Supports Google and email/password login options.
-   JWT-based token validation for APIs.

### Wallet Management

-   Add money to wallets dynamically.
-   Display real-time wallet balances per user.

### Transactions

-   Record complete transaction history, including:
    -   Amount details.
    -   Timestamps.
    -   Users involved.
-   Comprehensive transaction status (success, pending).

### Admin Dashboard

-   Manage user accounts (planned enhancement).
-   Oversee overall wallet activity.

### User Experience

-   Intuitive design powered by **Tailwind CSS**.
-   Mobile and desktop-friendly user interface.

### Real-time Notifications

-   Feedback for wallet top-ups and transactions. _(Upcoming feature)_

### Reliability

-   Postgres-backed transactional integrity.
-   Integrated CI/CD workflows for thorough testing and consistent updates.

----------

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

### Core Technologies

-   **Next.js**: Full-stack framework for server-side rendering and API development.
-   **NextAuth.js**: Handles user authentication with multiple strategies.
-   **PostgreSQL**: A reliable relational database for storing wallet and transaction data.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive, utility-first CSS designs.

### Additional Tools

-   **Prisma**: ORM for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
-   **Docker**: Ensures seamless cross-platform development and deployment.
-   **GitHub Actions**: Automates CI/CD workflows.

----------

## ⚙️ **Setup and Usage**

### Prerequisites

-   Install **Node.js**, **npm**, and **Docker**.
-   Ensure a running instance of **PostgreSQL** (via Docker or standalone).

### Local Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    
    `git clone https://github.com/RohitPithani026/Paytm-Project.git`
    `cd Paytm-Project` 
    
2.  Install dependencies:
    
    `npm install` 
    
3.  Setup environment variables by creating `.env.local`:
    
    `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>`
    `NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000`
    `NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<your-secret-key>` 
    
4.  Run database migrations:
  
    `npx prisma migrate dev` 
    
5.  Start the development server:
 
    `npm run dev` 
    
6.  Access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
    

----------

## 🐳 **Docker Integration**

### Simplified Setup

The project includes **Docker** configuration to simplify development and deployment:

1.  Build and launch the containers using **Docker Compose**:
   
    `docker-compose up --build` 
    
2.  Access the running services at:
    
    -   App: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    -   Postgres database is pre-configured in `docker-compose.yml`.

----------

## 🔄 **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

This project includes a CI/CD pipeline to ensure reliability:

### Workflows

-   **Pre-push checks**:
    -   Linting and testing.
    -   Build validation.
-   **Automatic deployment** upon merges into `main`.

### Configuration

-   The workflow is managed via GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`.

### Pipeline Highlights

1.  **Linting**: Ensures code quality.
2.  **Database Migrations**: Automatically applied on deployment.
3.  **Dockerization**: Builds and deploys Docker images.

----------

## 📊 **Database Design**

### Tables and Relationships

-   **User Table**: Stores user credentials and authentication details.
-   **Wallet Table**: Maps each user to their wallet.
-   **Transaction Table**: Tracks the history and details of transactions.

### Highlights

-   **Data Consistency**: Ensured by Postgres ACID transactions.
-   **Scalability**: Optimized schema for high-volume transactions.
